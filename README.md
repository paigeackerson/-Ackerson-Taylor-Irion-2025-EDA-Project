### Abstract
Elevational gradients serve as natural laboratories for examining species distributions and responses to environmental variability, yet understanding seasonal elevational movements, particularly in tropical bird species, remains incomplete. This study proposes to leverage eBird data to determine whether elevational migrant bird species can be identified through community science datasets. We will focus on two species of manakins in Costa Rica: one known to be an elevational migrant and another a sedentary resident. Using data from eBird, we will estimate the abundance of both species across an elevational gradient during two distinct seasons. Analyses will be conducted in R using the auk package to model abundance as a function of elevation and season. We predict a significant seasonal effect on the abundance of the migratory species, with no such effect for the sedentary species. This study highlights the potential of community science data to uncover patterns in avian elevational migration, providing insights into the movement ecology of bird species in montane regions.
